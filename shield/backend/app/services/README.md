# AI Agent Automation

This service integrates advanced LLM-based cyber security agents into the SHIELD platform, providing automated security testing capabilities.

## Overview

The AI Agent Automation service uses large language models to:

1. Generate targeted security test cases based on an organization's technology stack
2. Simulate attacks in a secure sandbox environment
3. Analyze results to identify vulnerabilities
4. Provide remediation suggestions

## Architecture

The integration consists of:

- **AIAgentManager**: Core class that orchestrates the AI-driven security assessments
- **API Endpoints**: REST APIs for initiating assessments and retrieving results
- **Frontend Interface**: React-based UI for configuring and visualizing assessments

## Components

### Backend Services

- `ai_agent_automation.py`: Main service that manages AI agent workflows
- API routes in `routes.py` for accessing the service

### Frontend Components

- `AIAgentAutomation.js`: React component for interacting with the AI agent service

## Usage

1. Navigate to the AI Agent Automation page in the SHIELD dashboard
2. Select an organization and specify its technology stack
3. Choose the type of assessment (vulnerability scan, penetration test, etc.)
4. Run the assessment
5. Review identified vulnerabilities and recommended remediation steps

## Technical Details

The service leverages:

- LangChain for orchestrating LLM interactions
- OpenAI API for the underlying AI capabilities
- SQLAlchemy for storing test cases and vulnerability data

## Integration with Cyber Security LLM Agents

This service integrates concepts from the "cyber-security-llm-agents" project, specifically:

1. Using AI agents to automate security testing
2. Applying LLM for security-specific tasks
3. Simulating attacks in a sandboxed environment

The implementation follows a simplified approach compared to the original project, focusing on:

- Ease of integration with the existing SHIELD architecture
- User-friendly interface for non-technical users
- Real-time feedback on security issues

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with real security testing tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Metasploit)
- Agent-to-agent collaboration for more sophisticated attack simulations
- Customizable test case templates for specific industry compliance requirements
